261. Unescaping HTML elements

so basically we are just replacing the particular HTML elements as a human readable text

&quot to single quotes
etc more can be found in https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp

to unscape in python 
we have to import HTML module
and use 
html.unescape(parameters)

so after using it on a text then the text has been unescaped, means it is completely human readable 










264. Python typing 

we can set the data types of a variable before giving it a value

age : int

age = 12 will be fine
age = "12" will give an error

same goes for the functions suring init

def func1(name: str)
will only take a string

def func(name : ui_class)
will take the object from ui_class 


similarly we can address or assign a return type of the functions

def police_check(age : int) -> bool
means it should return a boolean
if we return a string, then it will raise a typeError
