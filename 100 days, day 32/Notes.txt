245. How to Send emails using SMTP

BTS

after the receiver logs in to the site, then it will be downloaded
for doing this it relies on SMTP
simple mail transfer protocol

smtplib is the python code


import smtplib

my_email = "gm"
password = "v" # app password

# creating a connection through the server
connection = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com",587)

# TLS stand for transport layer security  # way of securing our connection to our email server # encrypting our mail
connection.starttls()
connection.login(user=my_email, password=password)
connection.sendmail(from_addr=my_email, to_addrs="jeil.com", msg="Hello there!!")
connection.close()

working perfectly fine after including port 587.
havent included subject for the email

connection.sendmail(from_addr=my_email, to_addrs="jil.com", msg="Subject:HBD\n\nHello there!!\nThis is body of my email.")
this will just include the subject 


just like opening a file we are also opening a connection
so similarly we can use the with keyword to automatically close the connection 


import smtplib

my_email = "gail.com"
password = "vkwv" # app password

# creating a connection through the server
with (smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com",587)) as connection:

    # TLS stand for transport layer security  # way of securing our connection to our email server # encrypting our mail
    connection.starttls()
    connection.login(user=my_email, password=password)
    connection.sendmail(
        from_addr=my_email, 
        to_addrs="jl.com", 
        msg="Subject:HBD\n\nHello there!!\nThis is body of my email."
        )


now it looks a lot more neet 














246. Working with python datetime module 

import datetime as dt

now = (dt.datetime.now()) # will get the current dat and time

print(type(now))
<class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(now)
2025-07-25 22:13:58.908415

print(now.year)
print(now.month)
print(now.weekday())
print(now.date())

computer start counting from 0
and if it is 1 then it is tuesday

i mean their week starts from monday 




247. Challenge 1 Monday Motivation Quote


import datetime as dt
import random
import smtplib

now = dt.datetime.now()
day = now.weekday()

# print(day)

with open(r"C:\Usees.txt", mode="r") as quotes:
    quotes_list = quotes.readlines()

todays_quote = random.choice(quotes_list)

my_email = "ch5ad5n"
pwd = "e5d4wf
swt"

if day == 4:
    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com",587) as connection:
        connection.starttls()
        connection.login(user=my_email, password=pwd)
        connection.sendmail(
            from_addr=my_email,
            to_addrs=my_email,
            msg=f"Subject:Testing Motivation\n\n{todays_quote}"
            )

249. Running the code on cloud 

using pythonanywhere.com
for free 


just change the absolute file path to relative file path when uploading to cloud
i wont do it now, as i feel this is not necessary to host
maybe a playable game on a website may work
 in free tier you can only run one task at a time.
