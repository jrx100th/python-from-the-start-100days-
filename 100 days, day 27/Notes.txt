GUI started with MAC Lisa commercially

import tkinter

window = tkinter.Tk()                   # screen initialization
window.title("My first GUI Program")    # window title
window.minsize(width=500, height=300)   # sizing 

# Label
my_label = tkinter.Label(text="Labella",font=("Arial",24,"bold"))
my_label.pack()                         # text wont be visible untill it is packed



window.mainloop()                       # without this the window will be closed instantly
                                        # should be placed in the bottom of the code 



## 206

Kwargs = keyword arguments

parameters even though they are not listed in the list of properties we are able to use them
just by typing them in 

advanced python arguments

arguments with default values
so when creating a function, jujst assign them values

and when the default values need to be changed, it can be modified when calling the function

eg : 
def my_function(a=1,b=2,c=3):
    # Do this with a 
    # Do this with b
    # Do this with c

when calling 
my_function(b=5)   # now the default value is overrided
a and c will be the same default value 



positional arguments are the required arguments 
that needs to assigned to the function 


What is the output of this code?

def foo(a, b=4, c=6): 
    print(a, b, c)
 
foo(4, 9)

output : 4 9 6
only c get's default value





207. *args : many positional arguments 

def add(n1,n2):
    return n1+n2 

add(n1=5,n2=3)

works for two arguments 


unlimited arguments

def add(*args):
    for n in args:
        print(n)

args is not required it is just a variable name
* tells python 
the function can expect any number of arguments

and then loop through the arguments of tuple

add(3,5,7,8)





208. **kwargs many keyword arguments
calling by the name rather than the position

def calculate(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)

calculate(add=3, multiply=5)

calculate()

it is a dictionary
{
    "add" : 3,
    "multiply" : 5
}

in tkinter module multiple properties in multiple functions are kept as kwargs

for any thing to appear on the screen each component needs to be packed
label, button


all widgets

text-entry-box for multiple lines of text.
spinbox = counter

scale

checkbutton

radiobutton

listbox for choices



3 layout managers

Pack = packs each element next to each other(below the previous one)
can be changed using side
but moving it a bit up or down is lot more complicated



Place = gives x and y values to the widgets (coordinates)
if there are many widgets then it will be difficult to manage their positions



Grid = has rows and columns
it fill one by one
like even if i assign first element in the column=5,row=5
if the previous cells are not filled then the element will take the first spot
even though the position is clerly specified

cant use grid and pack in the same program


if a widget is defined but layout is not specified then it wont be shown on the screen



# Adding a little bit of padding around components
directly modify the widgets
