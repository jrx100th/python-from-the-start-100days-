Lets DIY our own bloomberg terminal

we can check each company stocks over different times
change the time zone to exchange = the time of stock exchange

python program to trade stocks 
1. stock prices for a company using an API = pulling in yesterdays closing price and previous day closing price 
yesterday cp = 1000usd
previous  cp = 900usd 
diff         = 100
direction    = up
percentage rise = 100/900

on previous it is 10% lower than yesterday 
we will set a program to detect this significant change and then inform back(callback)
lets put that change for 10% 

2. API to fetch out relevant news 
so it will give the reason for the change of the stock price 

3. send our selves a message
so that we can decide on selling our stock or buying new ones.

so we have to read the API documentation by ourselves and figure out what to documentation
and then decide 

i think 
yesterday's closing price vs. today's opening price.
is way better than angela strategy
since i choosed extra hard(accidentally), i will have some liberty to whatever i want

for api keys
everything upto and not including the question mark
